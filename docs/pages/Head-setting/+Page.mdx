The `Head` setting allows you to add `<head>` tags to your pages.

> See <Link href="/head" /> for a general introduction and for other ways to add `<head>` tags.

> As explained <Link href="#only-html">below</Link>, it's only used when rendering the HTML of the first page the user visits. Consequently, it usually cannot be used for setting the `<title>` value.

```jsx
// /pages/+Head.jsx
// /pages/+Head.vue
// Environment: server

import previewImage from './previewImage.jpg'
import favicon from './favicon.png'
import iconMobile from './iconMobile.png'

export function Head() {
  return <>
    {/* Adding a script tag */}
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://example.com/some-script.js"></script>

    {/* Icon shown in the browser tab (aka favicon) */
    <link rel="icon" href={favicon}>

    {/* Icon shown on mobile homescreens (PWA) */
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href={iconMobile}>

    {/* Image shown when sharing on social sites (Twitter, WhatsApp, ...) */}
    <meta property="og:image" content={previewImage}>
  </>
}
```

## Using data

You can set `<head>` tags based on <Link href="/data-fetching">fetched data</Link> (or <Link href="/pageContext">`pageContext`</Link>) with:

- `useData()` (or `usePageContext()`) inside `+Head`
- `useConfig()` inside `+data` or components.

**`usePageContext()` and `useData()`**

The value defined by the `Head` setting is a component and thus you can use <Link href="/usePageContext">`usePageContext()`</Link> and <Link href="/useData">`useData()`</Link> as usual:

```jsx
// /pages/product/@id/+Head.js
// Environment: server

import { useData } from 'vike-react/useData' // or vike-vue / vike-solid

export function Head() {
  const data = useData()
  return <>
    {/* Image shown when sharing on social sites (Twitter, WhatsApp, ...) */}
    <meta property="og:image" content={data.product.image}>
  </>
}
```

**`useConfig()`**

See <Link href="/useConfig"/>.


## Only HTML

### Only renders for the first page's HTML

The `<Head>` component is only used when rendering the HTML of the first page the user visits: the tags set by `<Head>` aren't updated upon <Link href="/client-routing">client-side page navigation</Link>.

### Limitation

The most notable limitation is that the `Head` setting cannot be used to set the `<title>` value, because the title isn't updated upon client-side navigating between two pages that have a different title.

> See <Link href="#example">example below</Link> for a more detailed explanation.

For use cases where the `Head` setting cannot be used, Vike offers settings that update upon client-side navigation, such as the <Link href="/title">`title` setting</Link>.

> Don't hesitate to reach out if you have a use case that you cannot achieve.


### Just a small limitation

This may seem like a strong limitation but it actually isn't: the vast majority of `<head>` tags are only meant for HTML crawling.

For example, you can use the `Head` setting for:

- SEO and social sharing.
  > Search engine bots as well as social sharing bots (aka SMO) navigate your website only by using HTML requests: they don't execute client-side JavaScript and, consequently, don't do client-side navigation.

  > While Google can do client-side navigation, it still discovers `<head>` tags by using its HTML crawler.
- Favicon.
  > Assuming you have only one global favicon (`<link rel="icon">`) that applies to all pages there isn't any need to update it upon client-side navigation.
- PWA settings.
  > PWA settings are global and there isn't any need to update them upon client-side navigation.
- Adding `<script>` tags.
  > Assuming scripts should apply to all pages.

### Example

For example, in the following, using the `Head` setting for `<title>` doens't work while it does work for `<meta name="description">`.

```js
// /pages/index/+Head.jsx
// Environment: server

function Head() {
  return <>
    <title>AwesomeRockets</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The rocket company.">
  </>
}
```
```js
// /pages/about/+Head.jsx
// Environment: server

function Head() {
  return <>
    <title>About us</title>
    <meta name="description" content="We deliver payload to space.">
  </>
}
```

If the first URL the user visits is `/` then the rendered HTML is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>AwesomeRockets</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The rocket company.">
  </head>
</html>
```

If the user then clicks on a link `<a href="/about">About us</a>`, then Vike does client-side navigation and the page's title isn't updated: the browser sill shows `Welcome` even though the URL is now `/about`. That's because the <Link href="/client-routing">HTML isn't used upon client-side navigation (DOM manipulations are made instead)</Link> while the `Head` setting only sets HTML.

> The `<Head>` component is only loaded on the server-side and only used when rendering HTML of the first page by design.

This isn't an issue for `<meta name="description">` tag because it's meant for search engines bots which
<Link href="#:~:text=Search%20engine%20bots%20as%20well%20as%20social%20sharing%20bots%20(aka%20SMO)%20navigate%20your%20website%20only%20by%20using%20HTML%20requests">crawl your website using HTML</Link>.


## Cumulative

The `Head` setting is cumulative. For example:

```jsx
// /pages/+Head.js
// Environment: server

import favicon from './favicon.png'

export const Head = () =>
  // This favicon applies to all pages
  <link rel="icon" href={favicon}>
```

```jsx
// /pages/about-us/+Head.js
// Environment: server

import previewImage from './previewImage.jpg'

export const Head = () =>
  // Both the favicon above and this tag applies to /pages/about-us/+Page.js
  <meta property="og:image" content={previewImage}>
```

You can, however, apply different `Head` settings to different pages:

```jsx
// /pages/(marketing)/+Head.js
// Environment: server

import favicon from './favicon.png'

// Applies to all marketing pages
export const Head = () => <link rel="icon" href={favicon}>
```

```jsx
// /pages/admin/+Head.js
// Environment: server

import favicon from './favicon.png'

// Applies to all admin pages
export const Head = () => <link rel="icon" href={favicon}>
```
