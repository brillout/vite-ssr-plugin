Deep dive into what makes Vike special.

- Vike's <Link href="#philosophy">philosophy</Link>.


## Architecture

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility in mind.

**Flexible by design**

Vike's flexibility is powered by low-level APIs.

For example, Vike's lowel-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integrating any:
 - UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using these low-level APIs. For example, use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if the need arises for more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into any:
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Deployement (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rending">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.

**Flexible by prioritization**

If you create a feature request and explain why not having this feature is blocking you then we'll treat it with higher priority.

**Conservative or cutting-edge, your choice**

Vike in itself is a flexible and reliable core with, on top of it, extensions that integrate tools. It's a robust foundation fostering a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>:
 - Stable extensions focus on supporting businesses in a stable and long-term fashion
 - Cutting-edge extensions focus on experimenting and adopting new and latest approaches.

> For example, we're experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users. We'll maintain both extensions for the foreseeable future. Enabling you to adopt new techonology only if you see fit at your own pace.

So that:
 - If you prefer stability, choose stable extensions go with a conservative stack by stable extensions for unprecedented stability.
   > You can unprecedented stability: Vike's core is stable in itself and Vike extensions are thin layers of glue that can be maintained for a very long time.
 - If you have special requirements or wants to explore new techniques: choose cutting-edge extensions, <Link href="/eject">eject extensions</Link>, write your own extensions, or <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link>.
   > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture and <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link> and cutting-edge extensions provide unprecedented opportunities to push the envelope.

If you choose a conservative stack, you'll still benefit from other companies push the envelope of peformance and DX. Progressively migrate...


**Choose your stack, as you go**

Vike's architectural freedom is also important so that you can continuously and progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs without having a costly framework migration.

> For example, Vike enables you to start with an SPA and later, if end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can easily add SSR</Link> to your existing app.


**Adopt the future, progressively**

Vike enables you to stay on a conservative stack as long you want while migrating towards new tools and apporaches one step at a time:
 - One architectural component at a time.
   > TODO
 - One page at a time.
   > TODO

Say goodbye to big never-ending migrations.


**Future-proof**

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem.

Vike is a robust foundation with a thin flexible layer (Vike extensions) quickly adapting to the tools and approaches of tomorrow.


## Philosophy

Vike is driven by our core principles.

**Seperation of concerns**

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns in mind, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

The enables core architectural components to be developed independently of each other, such as data fetching (RPC, REST, GraphQL)

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components with their framework which we believe is fundamental and structural mistake. For example, Next.js tightly couples RPC (Server Actions) while it's notoriously hard to integrate GraphQL with Next.js. Gatsby, on the other hand, tightly couples GraphQL. It's Vike's core believe to separate the data fetching tools from the frontend framework; that way you can choose any data fething strategy and progressively migrate from one to another.

**Flourishing do-one-thing-do-it-well ecosystem**

Vike's flexible core provides a **wide surface for innovation** — the secret sauce to JavaScript's vibrant ecosystem.


**Strong leadership**

Vike is an independent project 100% led by engineers and we don't serve the interests of any unrelated business: we only serve your interests.

We meticulously care about each aspect of Vike and our passion is at the heart of makes Vike unique, for example:
- Vike's team is responsive and we provide <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">a clear guideline</Link> on how to receive reliable assistance.
- We carefully designed Vike's *Open Source Pricing* to keep code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount. We believe it's paramount for a transparent and sustainable relationship, while keeping Vike accessible to everyone.


**User-driven**

We listen to users and engage in constructive conversations. We aren't driven by implementing fancy features, we are driven by implementing features that solves real user problems.

Thanks to our Open Source Pricing your success also translates in (financial) success for us.

> Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to prioritize SSR over other use cases.
