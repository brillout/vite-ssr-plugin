Rationale for using Vike.

## Your stack, your choice

You can use any:
- UI framework (React, Vue, Solid, ...)
- Renderering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, MPA, islands, ...)
- Data fetching (RPC, GraphQL, REST, ...)
- Deployment strategy (static, server, edge, ...)
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility in mind. So that Vike can adopt your company requirements.

> With other frameworks, it's often the other way around: you have to adapt your company requirements to the framework. With Vike, this is a rare outcome.

**Flexible by design**

Vike's flexible design is powered by **low-level APIs**.

For example, by using Vike's lowel-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> you can integrate an UI framework (React, Vue, ...) you want.

> When getting started with Vike you usually don't use these low-level APIs and you use Vike extensions instead. (Vike extensions essentially implement such low-level hooks on your behalf.)
>
> For example, most users start with `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if you need more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` and go with a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> which enables you to embed Vike into:
- Any server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Any deployement environment (AWS, Cloudflare, Vecel, ...)

Vike's architectural freedom is also important so that you can continuously and progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs without having a costly framework migration.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components with their framework which we believe is fundamental and structural mistake. For example, Next.js tightly couples RPC (Server Actions) while it's notoriously hard to integrate GraphQL with Next.js. Gatsby, on the other hand, tightly couples GraphQL. It's Vike's core believe to separate the data fetching tools from the frontend framework; that way you can choose any data fething strategy and progressively migrate from one to another.

> For example, Vike enables you to start with an SPA and later, if end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can easily add SSR</Link> to your existing app.

**Flexible by prioritization**

Not only is Vike flexible by design, but it's also flexible by prioritization: if you create a feature requests and explain why not having this feature is blocking you then we'll treat your request with higher priority.

Last but not least, we quickly fix bugs (usually under 24 hours) as bugs are often blockers.



## Cutting edge, at your own pace

Vike's dual approach of having stable as well as cutting-edge extensions gives you choice:
- Go without a conservative stack &mdash; if your company prefers stability.
- G

> While some are early adopters, most companies prefer stability. Not every company has the capacity to risk experimenting with new and unstable technology.
>
> For companies exploring the technological frontier, Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture and <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link> and cutting-edge extensions provide unprecedented opportunities to push the envelope.

## Eject, for fully custom integrations

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start and, later, if an extension doesn't integrate a tool exactly as you need, you can eject it and fully customize the integration.

If you were to eject all extensions, then you would have complete control over how tools integrate with Vike and with each other. We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.

You get the best of both worlds: a quick start without compromising on flexibility.

> For example, you can use <UiFrameworkExtension name /> to get a quick start like a regular framework (Next.js/Nuxt/...) while, later, you can eject and fully customize the React/Vue/Solid integration.


## Build Your Own Framework

## Less blockers, by caring and prioritization

Vike is flexible not only by design but also by prioritization: we focus on the long tail of details and features that unblock users. It's often the small details that decide whether you can achieve your goal.

> For example, with Vike, you have <Link href="/data#environment">fine-grained control over where data is fetched from</Link>: the server-side, client-side, or both. It's a small but essential feature for Vike's first-class support of both:
> - <Link href="/pre-rendering">SSG</Link> apps, which usually lean more on the client.
> - SSR apps, which usually lean more on the server.

<Link href="/faq#i-can-t-achieve-what-i-want-can-i-get-help">We encourage users to reach out</Link> if they run into a blocker caused by Vike. It's also helpful for us, as we prioritize resolving blockers (ideally by design and at least by providing help). The more use cases we know about, the better.

A common source of blockers are bugs, and that's why we [systematically and quickly fix bugs](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues?q=label%3A%22bug+%3Aboom%3A%22+) &mdash; usually under 24 hours.


## Reliable

Vike's architecture provides a robust foundation.

## Stable core, for stability and innovation

Vike, essentially, is a core that is extensible, robust, and stable.

This sturdy core provides stability and fosters innovation, enabling a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

Prominent extensions focus on supporting businesses in a stable and long-term fashion, while cutting-edge extensions push the envelope on performance and DX.

Only carefully selected and battle-tested new techniques make it to stable extensions.

> For example, we're experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users.
>
> After (and only if) we're confident about RSC, we will release it as `vike-react` and rename the current extension to `vike-react-classic` while maintaining both extensions for the foreseeable future.


## Philosophy

Everything we do is driven by our core principles. These are the fundamental reasons why we believe you can trust Vike.

## Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture

Vike is meticulously designed with a clean separation of concerns. , enabling:
 - You have the architectural freedom.
 - Architectural components can be developed independently of each other.

for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

- Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture
  > Designed with a **clean separation of concerns**, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

- Community-driven
  > Led by a team of engineers that is responsive and **driven by the success of its users**. Your success is our success.

- JavaScript unleashed
  > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture creates a **wide surface for innovation** â€” the secret sauce to JavaScript's vibrant ecosystem.




## Optional Control

## Led by engineers

Vike is an independent project 100% led by engineers: we don't serve the interests of an unrelated business &mdash; we only serve the interests of our users.

> This makes a profound and fundamental difference.

> For example, we also care about the "old-school" setup of having a Java/PHP/Ruby backend with a decoupled statically deployed frontend. Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to prioritize differently.
