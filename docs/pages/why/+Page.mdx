## Architecture

### Flexible by design

Vike is powered by low-level hooks. For example, the hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integrating:
 - Any UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Any Data connection (REST, GraphQL, RPC, ...)
 - Any Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using such low-level hooks. For example, if you use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` then you get a quick start like Next.js and Nuxt. Later, if the need arises, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into:
- Any server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Any deployment (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.


### Conservative or cutting-edge, your choice

Vike is a core with, on top of it, <Link href="/extensions">extensions</Link> that integrate tools. It fosters a diverse ecosystem of Vike extensions:
 - Stable extensions, focusing on supporting conservative stacks in a long-term fashion.
 - Cutting-edge extensions, focusing on experimenting new approaches.

> For example, we are experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users. Both extensions can be maintained for the foreseeable future, enabling you to adopt RSC only if you want and whenever you want.

This gives you choice:
 - If you prefer stability, choose stable extensions.
   > You get unparalleled stability: Vike in itself is stable and Vike extensions are a thin layer of glue code that can be maintained for a very long time.
 - If you have special requirements or if you want to explore new approaches you can: choose cutting-edge extensions, <Link href="/eject">eject extensions</Link>, write your own extensions, and/or <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link>.
   > You get unparalleled flexibility to build what you need.

In a nutshell: Vike enables unprecedented flexibility and dependability.


### Grow progressively

You can progressively adapt your stack to evolving needs.
 - **One page at a time**: you can <Link href="/config#powerful">change your stack progressively on a page-by-page basis</Link>.
   > For example, you can start with SPA and later, if the need arises, <Link href="/ssr">you can progressively add SSR</Link> one page at a time.

   > Configs can be set on page-by-page basis thanks to <Link href="/config#inheritance">Vike's powerful config inheritance</Link>.
 - **One architectural component at a time**: you can switch architectural components independently of each other.
   > For example, you can start with [RPC](https://telefunc.com/RPC) and later, if the need arises, you can progressively switch to GraphQL.

   > You can swap every major architectural component thanks to Vike's <Link href="#separation-of-concerns">separation of concerns</Link>.


Progressive migrations enable you to migrate much faster, iteratively, and in parallel to building your product.


### Future-proof

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem. It's a stable foundation with lightweight and flexible Vike extensions quickly adapting to the tools and approaches of tomorrow.


### Flexible and reliable, by prioritization

If you create a feature request and explain why it's blocking you then we treat it with higher priority.

We quickly fix bugs (usually within 24 hours).

Vike's team is responsive and we provideÂ <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">a guideline</Link> on how to receive assistance from us.


### Build your own framework

Vike enables you to <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build company internal frameworks</Link>, empowering your Software Architects to fully own the architecture while providing your Product Developers with a company framework to quickly experiment, iterate, and ship production-grade apps.

Your framework can include everything (frontend, backend, data fetching, authentication, deployment, error tracking, analytics, ...) so that your Product Developers can focus on what they do best: building user interfaces.

Vike enables you to build your own internal ecosystem of tools. It's a powerful way to scale your teams, and to ensure a cohesive stack throughout your company.




## Philosophy


### Separation of concerns

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns, for unprecedented flexibility and stability.

Enabling you to choose architectural components independently of each other, and progressively switch them as you grow.


### Flourishing do-one-thing-do-it-well ecosystem

Vike's separation of concerns enables architectural components to be developed independently of each other.

A vibrant ecosystem of do-one-thing-do-it-well tools that compete with each other is one of the strongest driving force behind JavaScript's success.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components together, which is a structural hindrance that prevents innovation.
>
> For example, Vike doesn't have built-in [RPC](https://telefunc.com/RPC) (aka Server Actions). This flexibility enables RPC approaches to be developed and innovated independently of Vike.
>
> Another example is GraphQL tools, which are notoriously hard (sometimes not even feasible) to integrate with other frameworks.


### Listening to users

We engage in constructive conversations with users. While we enjoy pushing the envelope and innovating, our priority is, first and foremost, to listen and solve the real-world needs of users.

Vike's <Link href="/pricing">Open Source Pricing</Link> means that your success directly translates into our success. (Whereas other frameworks that make money from selling other products are inclined to have skewed priorities.)


### Passionate leadership

Vike is an independent project 100% led by engineers, with long-term visions and a clear plan.

Thanks to Vike's <Link href="/pricing">Open Source Pricing</Link> we don't serve the agenda of any unrelated business: we only serve the interests of users.

We are passionate about technology and strive for an increasingly collaborative society.
