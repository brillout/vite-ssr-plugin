## Architecture

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility in mind.

**Flexible by design**

Vike's flexibility is powered by low-level APIs.

For example, Vike's lowel-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integrating any:
 - UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using these low-level APIs. For example, use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if the need arises for more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into any:
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Deployement (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rending">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.

**Flexible by prioritization**

If you create a feature request and explain why not having this feature is blocking you then we'll treat it with higher priority.

We quickly fix bugs (usually under 24 hours) as bugs are often blockers.

**Conservative or cutting-edge, your choice**

Vike in itself is a flexible and reliable core with, on top of it, extensions integrating tools.

It's a robust foundation fostering a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>:
 - Stable extensions focus on supporting businesses in a stable and long-term fashion
 - Cutting-edge extensions focus on experimenting and adopting new and latest approaches.

So that:
 - If your company prefers stability, go with a conservative stack by stable extensions for unprecedented stability.
 > Unprecendent
 - If your company has special requirements or wants to explore the technological frontier, choose cutting-edge or write your own extensions, or build your own framework.
 > Flexible Unprecendent flexibility and cutting-edge.

If you choose a conservative stack, you'll still benefit from other companies push the envelope of peformance and DX. Progressively migrate...

> For companies exploring the technological frontier, Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture and <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link> and cutting-edge extensions provide unprecedented opportunities to push the envelope.

**Adopt the future, progressively**

Vike enables you to stay on a conservative stack as long you need to while migrating towards new tools and apporaches one page and one architectural component at a time.

Say goodbye to big never-ending migrations.

> For example, we're experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users. We'll maintain both extensions for the foreseeable future. Enabling you to adopt new techonology only if you see fit at your own pace.


**Future-proof**

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem.

You can think of it as a robust foundation with a thin flexible layer (Vike extensions) that can quickly adopt and invent the tools and approaches of tomorrow.

## Philosophy

Everything we do is guided by our core beliefs &mdash; the essence of Vike.

**User-driven**

**Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture**

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns in mind, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.
 - You have the architectural freedom.
 - Architectural components can be developed independently of each other.

- Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture
  > Designed with a **clean separation of concerns**, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

- Community-driven
  > Led by a team of engineers that is responsive and **driven by the success of its users**. Your success is our success.

- JavaScript unleashed
  > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture creates a **wide surface for innovation** — the secret sauce to JavaScript's vibrant ecosystem.

**Flourishing do-one-thing-do-it-well ecosystem**

Vike flexible core is a robust foundation fostering innovation


**Led by engineers**

Vike is an independent project 100% led by a strong leadership of engineers: we don't serve the interests of an unrelated business &mdash; we only serve the interests of our users.

Building a framework is complex and it's paramount for a framework to be led by a strong engineering leadership that deeply cares about design.

> This makes a profound and fundamental difference.

> For example, we also care about the "old-school" setup of having a Java/PHP/Ruby backend with a decoupled statically deployed frontend. Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to prioritize differently.

**Strong leadership**

Vike's team is responsive <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">with a clear guideline</Link> on how to receive assistance.

We designed Vike's *Open Source Pricing* to keep code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount, for a transparent and sustainable relationship.

## Trash


So that Vike can adopt your company requirements.
> With other frameworks, it's often the other way around: you have to adapt your company requirements to the framework. With Vike, this is a rare outcome.

- Data fetching (RPC, GraphQL, REST, ...)


> Vike's architectural freedom is also important so that you can continuously and progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs without having a costly framework migration.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components with their framework which we believe is fundamental and structural mistake. For example, Next.js tightly couples RPC (Server Actions) while it's notoriously hard to integrate GraphQL with Next.js. Gatsby, on the other hand, tightly couples GraphQL. It's Vike's core believe to separate the data fetching tools from the frontend framework; that way you can choose any data fething strategy and progressively migrate from one to another.

> For example, Vike enables you to start with an SPA and later, if end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can easily add SSR</Link> to your existing app.

> Vike's flexibility enables you to replicate any framework, or better yet, <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link> tailored to your company requirements and that integrates all your tools: frontend, backend, data fetching, authentication, deployement, etc. This enables your junior developers to focus on building user interfaces while giving your senior developers the power of fully owning the architecture. It's a powerful way to scale your teams and have a cohesive stack throughout your company.


Bugs are quickly fixed (usually under 24 hours).
