## Your stack, your choice

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility in mind.

**Flexible by design**

Vike's flexibility is powered by low-level APIs.

For example, Vike's lowel-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integration so that you can use any:
 - UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using these low-level APIs. For example, use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if the need arises for more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.


Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into any:
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Deployement (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rending">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.

**Flexible by prioritization**

For example, if you create a feature request and explain why not having this feature is blocking you then we'll treat it with higher priority.

**Cutting-edge or conservative stack, your choice**

Vike, essentially, is a core that is extensible, robust, and stable.

Vike's architecture provides a robust foundation and, on top of it, extensions.

This sturdy core provides stability and fosters innovation, enabling a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

Prominent extensions focus on supporting businesses in a stable and long-term fashion, while cutting-edge extensions push the envelope on performance and DX.

Only carefully selected and battle-tested new techniques make it to stable extensions.

> For example, we're experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users.
>
> After (and only if) we're confident about RSC, we will release it as `vike-react` and rename the current extension to `vike-react-classic` while maintaining both extensions for the foreseeable future.

Vike's dual approach of having stable as well as cutting-edge extensions gives you choice:
- Go without a conservative stack &mdash; if your company prefers stability.
- G

> While some are early adopters, most companies prefer stability. Not every company has the capacity to risk experimenting with new and unstable technology.
>
> For companies exploring the technological frontier, Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture and <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link> and cutting-edge extensions provide unprecedented opportunities to push the envelope.


## Reliable & future-proof

**A resilient foundation you can lean on**

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and **open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem** &mdash; place your bets on a framework that embraces the future.

Vike's core is a robust and stable and robust foundation is thin flexible layers quickly adopting the new tools and new approaches of tomorrow.

Not only does Vike's core enable unprecedented flexibility, it also enables resillience:
Vike's core, 90% of Vike's source code takes a couple of bets that  thin layers of code that can move easily and quickly. In other words, resillience, the capactiy to adapt to a fast moving environment such as JavaScript vibrant ecosystem.

In other words: Vike is resilient.

**Progressively adopt the future**

Vike enables you to stay on a conservative stack as long you need to while migrating towards new tools and apporaches one page and one architectural component at a time.

Say goodbye to big never-ending migrations.



**Strong leadership**

Vike's team is responsive <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">with a clear guideline</Link> on how to receive assistance.

Bugs are quickly fixed (usually under 24 hours).

We designed Vike's *Open Source Pricing* to keep code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount, for a transparent and sustainable relationship.

## Philosophy

Everything we do is guided by our core beliefs &mdash; the essence of Vike.

**User-driven**

**Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture**

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns in mind, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.
 - You have the architectural freedom.
 - Architectural components can be developed independently of each other.

- Do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture
  > Designed with a **clean separation of concerns**, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

- Community-driven
  > Led by a team of engineers that is responsive and **driven by the success of its users**. Your success is our success.

- JavaScript unleashed
  > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture creates a **wide surface for innovation** — the secret sauce to JavaScript's vibrant ecosystem.

**Led by engineers**

Vike is an independent project 100% led by engineers: we don't serve the interests of an unrelated business &mdash; we only serve the interests of our users.

> This makes a profound and fundamental difference.

> For example, we also care about the "old-school" setup of having a Java/PHP/Ruby backend with a decoupled statically deployed frontend. Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to prioritize differently.



## Trash


So that Vike can adopt your company requirements.
> With other frameworks, it's often the other way around: you have to adapt your company requirements to the framework. With Vike, this is a rare outcome.

- Data fetching (RPC, GraphQL, REST, ...)


> Vike's architectural freedom is also important so that you can continuously and progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs without having a costly framework migration.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components with their framework which we believe is fundamental and structural mistake. For example, Next.js tightly couples RPC (Server Actions) while it's notoriously hard to integrate GraphQL with Next.js. Gatsby, on the other hand, tightly couples GraphQL. It's Vike's core believe to separate the data fetching tools from the frontend framework; that way you can choose any data fething strategy and progressively migrate from one to another.

> For example, Vike enables you to start with an SPA and later, if end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can easily add SSR</Link> to your existing app.

> Vike's flexibility enables you to replicate any framework, or better yet, <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link> tailored to your company requirements and that integrates all your tools: frontend, backend, data fetching, authentication, deployement, etc. This enables your junior developers to focus on building user interfaces while giving your senior developers the power of fully owning the architecture. It's a powerful way to scale your teams and have a cohesive stack throughout your company.
