## Architecture

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility and reliability in mind.


**Flexible by design**

Vike's flexibility is powered by low-level APIs.

For example, Vike's low-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integrating any:
 - UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using these low-level APIs. For example, you can use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar to Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if the need arises for more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into any:
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Deployement (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rending">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.


**Flexible and reliable by prioritization**

If you create a feature request and explain why it's blocking you then we'll treat it with higher priority.

We quickly fix bugs (usually under 24 hours).


**Conservative or cutting-edge, your choice**

Vike in itself is a flexible and reliable core with, on top of it, extensions that integrate tools. It's a robust foundation fostering a diverse ecosystem of <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>:
 - Stable extensions, focusing on supporting conservative stacks in a long-term fashion.
 - Cutting-edge extensions, focusing on experimenting and adopting new approaches.

> For example, we're experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users. We will be able to maintain both extensions for the foreseeable future, enabling you to adopt RSC only if and when you want.

So that:
 - If you prefer stability, choose stable extensions.
   > You get unparalleled stability: Vike's core is stable in itself and Vike extensions are thin layers of glue that can be maintained for a very long time.
 - If you have special requirements or wants to explore new techniques: choose cutting-edge extensions, <Link href="/eject">eject extensions</Link>, write your own extensions, or <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link>.
   > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture provides unparalleled opportunities to experiment and push the envelope.

Vike enables you to keep your current stack while progressively migrating towards new tools and apporaches at your own pace.


**Choose progressively as you grow**

You can continuously and progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs.

You can do so:
 - One page at a time.
   > Vike enables you to <Link href="/config#powerful">progressively change your stack on a page-by-page basis</Link>.
 - One architectural component at a time.
   > With Vike, you can to switch architectural components independently of each other.

> Examples:
> - You can start with an SPA and, later if you end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can progressively add SSR</Link> one page at a time.
> - You can start with RPC and, later if the need arises, progressively switch to GraphQL.

Say goodbye to big never-ending migrations.


**Future-proof**

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem.

In other words, Vike is a robust foundation (Vike itself) with a thin and flexible layer (Vike extensions) quickly adapting to the tools and approaches of tomorrow.


**Build your own framework**

Vike enables you to <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build company internal frameworks</Link>, empowering your Software Architects to fully own the architecture while providing your Product Developers with a company framework to quickly experiment, test, iterate and ship production-grade apps.

Your can build a company framework that includes everything: frontend, backend, data fetching, authentication, deployement, etc. So that your Product Developers can focus on what they like most: building user interfaces.

Vike essentially enables you to build your own internal ecosystem of tools. It's a powerful way to scale your teams, and to ensure a cohesive stack throughout your company.




## Philosophy

Vike is driven by our core principles.


**Seperation of concerns**

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

You can choose any core architectural components, and progressively switch them as you grow.


**Flourishing do-one-thing-do-it-well ecosystem**

Vike's seperation of concerns enables architectural components to be developed independently of each other.

A vibrant ecosystem of do-one-thing-do-it-well tools competing with each other is one of the strongest driving force behind JavaScript's success.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components together, which is a structural hindrance that prevents innovation.
>
> For example, Vike doesn't have built-in <Link href="/https://telefunc.com/RPC">RPC</Link> (aka Server Actions), enabling RPC approaches to be developed and innovated independently of Vike.
>
> Another example is the seamlessly integration of GraphQL tools &mdash; something that is notoriously hard (sometimes not even feasible) with other frameworks.


**Strong leadership**

Vike is an independent project 100% led by engineers that don't serve the interests of any unrelated business: we only serve your interests.

We meticulously care about each aspect of Vike; our passion is at the heart of makes Vike unique. For example:
- Vike's team is responsive and we provideÂ <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">a clear guideline</Link> on how to receive reliable assistance.
- We carefully designed Vike's *Open Source Pricing* to keep code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount. For a transparent and sustainable relationship, while keeping Vike accessible to everyone.


**User-driven**

We listen to users and engage in constructive conversations. We aren't driven by implementing fancy features, we are driven by implementing features that solve real user problems.

Thanks to our Open Source Pricing your success directly translates in (financial) success for us.

> Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to have skewed prioritization.
