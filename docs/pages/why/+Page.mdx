Deep dive into what makes Vike special.
- Vike's <Link href="#architecture">architecture</Link>, enabling unprecedented flexibility and reliability.
- Vike's <Link href="#philosophy">philosophy</Link>.



## Architecture

From high-level design to the smallest details, Vike is built with flexibility and reliability in mind.


### Flexible by design

Vike's flexibility is powered by low-level APIs.

For example, Vike's low-level hooks <Link href="/onRenderHtml">`onRenderHtml()`</Link> and <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> give you full control over integrating any:
 - UI framework (React, Vue, ...)
 - Rendering strategy (SSR, SSG, SPA, islands, ...)

> For a quick start, we recommend using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> instead of directly using these low-level APIs. For example, you can use `vike-react` or `vike-vue` for a quick start similar to Next.js or Nuxt.
>
> Later, if the need arises for more control, you can <Link href="/eject">eject</Link> `vike-react`/`vike-vue` for a custom React/Vue integration.

Another example is Vike's server middleware <Link href="/renderPage"><code>renderPage()</code></Link> enabling you to embed Vike into any:
- Server (Express.js, Hono, Fastify, ...)
- Deployment (AWS, Cloudflare, Vercel, ...)

> Alternatively, you can <Link href="/pre-rendering">pre-render your pages</Link> and deploy your app to any static host.


### Flexible and reliable, by prioritization

If you create a feature request and explain why it's blocking then we treat it with higher priority.

We quickly fix bugs (usually under 24 hours).

Vike's team is responsive and we provideÂ <Link href="/faq#how-can-i-reach-out-for-help">a clear guideline</Link> on how to receive reliable assistance.


### Conservative or cutting-edge, your choice

Vike is a core with, on top of it, <Link href="/extensions">extensions</Link> that integrate tools. It fosters a diverse ecosystem of Vike extensions:
 - Stable extensions, focusing on supporting conservative stacks in a long-term fashion.
 - Cutting-edge extensions, focusing on experimenting and adopting new approaches.

> For example, we are experimenting with RSC (React Server Components) in a separate extension `vike-react-rsc`. This allows us to quickly iterate without disrupting `vike-react` users. We can maintain both extensions for the foreseeable future, enabling you to adopt RSC only if you want and whenever you want.

This gives you choice:
 - If you prefer stability, choose stable extensions.
   > You get unparalleled stability: Vike in itself is stable and Vike extensions are a thin layer of glue code that can be maintained for a long time.
 - If you have special requirements, or want to explore new approaches: choose cutting-edge extensions, <Link href="/eject">eject extensions</Link>, write your own extensions, or <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build your own framework</Link>.
   > Vike's do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture provides unparalleled opportunities to experiment and push the envelope.

Vike enables you to keep your current stack for as long as you want, while progressively migrating towards new tools and approaches at your own pace.


### Grow progressively

Not only can you <Link href="#conservative-or-cutting-edge-your-choice">adopt new technology at your pace</Link>, but you can also progressively adapt your stack to your evolving needs:
 - **One page at a time**: you can <Link href="/config#powerful">change your stack progressively on a page-by-page basis</Link>.
 - **One architectural component at a time**: you can switch architectural components independently of each other.

Progressive migrations enable you to migrate faster and in parralel to iterating on your product.

> For example:
> - You can start with SPA and, later if you end up needing SSR, <Link href="/ssr">you can progressively add SSR</Link> one page at a time.
> - You can start with <Link href="/https://telefunc.com/RPC">RPC</Link> and, later if the need arises, you can progressively switch to GraphQL.


### Future-proof

Vike's flexible core is unopinionated and open to JavaScript's rapidly evolving ecosystem.

Vike is a robust foundation (Vike itself) with a thin and flexible layer (Vike extensions) quickly adapting to the tools and approaches of tomorrow.


### Build your own framework

Vike enables you to <Link href="/build-your-own-framework">build company internal frameworks</Link>, empowering your Software Architects to fully own the architecture while providing your Product Developers with a company framework to quickly experiment, iterate, and ship production-grade apps.

Your framework can include everything (frontend, backend, data fetching, authentication, deployment, error tracking, analytics, ...) so that your Product Developers can focus on what they do best: building user interfaces.

Vike enables you to build your own internal ecosystem of tools. It's a powerful way to scale your teams, and to ensure a cohesive stack throughout your company.




## Philosophy


### Separation of concerns

Vike is carefully designed with a clean separation of concerns, for unprecedented flexibility and robustness.

Enabling you to choose architectural components independently of each other, and progressively switch them as you grow.


### Flourishing do-one-thing-do-it-well ecosystem

Vike's separation of concerns enables architectural components to be developed independently of each other.

A vibrant ecosystem of do-one-thing-do-it-well tools that compete with each other is one of the strongest driving force behind JavaScript's success.

> Other frameworks tightly couple architectural components together, which is a structural hindrance that prevents innovation.
>
> For example, Vike doesn't have built-in <Link href="/https://telefunc.com/RPC">RPC</Link> (aka Server Actions). This flexibility enables RPC approaches to be developed and innovated independently of Vike.
>
> Another example is GraphQL tools, which are notoriously hard (sometimes not even feasible) to integrate with other frameworks.


### User-driven

We listen to users and engage in constructive conversations. We aren't driven by implementing fancy features. We are driven by implementing features that solve real user problems.

Thanks to our Open Source Pricing your success directly translates into (financial) success for us.

> Other frameworks that make money from JavaScript server deployments are naturally inclined to have skewed prioritization.


### Next-generation business model

We carefully designed Vike's <Link href="/pricing">Open Source Pricing</Link> to keep code 100% open source (MIT license) and 100% gratis for software engineers while asking companies to pay a small amount.

For a transparent and sustainable relationship while keeping Vike accessible to everyone.


### Leadership

Vike is an **independent project 100% led by engineers**.

We don't serve the interests of any unrelated business: **we only serve the interests of our users**.

We are **passionate** about technology and deeply care about striving towards a **collaborative** society.

Beyond Vike's unparalleled flexibility, we have a clear and **bold vision** to establish it as a superior Next.js/Nuxt alternative in other fundamental aspects as well.
