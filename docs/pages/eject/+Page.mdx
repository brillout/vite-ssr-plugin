The [eject package](https://github.com/snake-py/eject) enables you to take control of Vike extensions.

<Construction>The eject pacakge is [work-in-progress](https://github.com/snake-py/eject/issues/7#issuecomment-2480853337).</Construction>

It moves the code of the extension from `/node_modules/vike-some-extension/` to your Git repository at `/ejected/vike-some-extension/`. This means you can then fully modify the code of `vike-some-extension`.

> The ejected code at `/ejected/vike-some-extension` is the built JavaScript, but there is [work-in-progress](https://github.com/snake-py/eject/issues/4) for copying the original source code (e.g. TypeScript) from the extension's Git repository (instead of copying `/node_modules/vike-some-extension/`).

> Eject also has limited support for other npm packages; Vike extensions are guaranteed to be fully supported.

## When to eject?

In genreal, before considering ejection, we recommend reaching out to the maintainer of the Vike extension and to consider making a Pull Request.

Only eject as a last resort &mdash; when it's clear that it's the only option.

## Eject, for fully custom integrations

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start and, later, if an extension doesn't integrate a tool exactly as you need, you can eject it and fully customize the integration.

If you were to eject all extensions, then you would have complete control over how tools integrate with Vike and with each other. We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.

You get the best of both worlds: a quick start without compromising on flexibility.

> For example, you can use <UiFrameworkExtension name /> to get a quick start like a regular framework (Next.js/Nuxt/...) while, later, you can eject and fully customize the React/Vue/Solid integration.
