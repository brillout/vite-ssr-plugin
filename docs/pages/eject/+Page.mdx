## Eject, for fully custom integrations

Use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link> for a quick start and, later, if an extension doesn't integrate a tool exactly as you need, you can eject it and fully customize the integration.

If you were to eject all extensions, then you would have complete control over how tools integrate with Vike and with each other. We call this <Link href="/optional-control">Optional Control</Link>.

You get the best of both worlds: a quick start without compromising on flexibility.

> For example, you can use <UiFrameworkExtension name /> to get a quick start like a regular framework (Next.js/Nuxt/...) while, later, you can eject and fully customize the React/Vue/Solid integration.
