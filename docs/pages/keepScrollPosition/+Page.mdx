import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Type: `boolean`  
Default value: `false`  

```js
// pages/product/@id/+config.js

export default {
  // Don't scroll to top when navigating between the pages defined at pages/product/@id/**
  keepScrollPosition: true
}
```

```bash
pages/product/@id/+config.js
# The scroll position is preserverd when navigating between these two pages:
pages/product/@id/pricing/+Page.js
pages/product/@id/reviews/+Page.js
```

By default, the page is scrolled to the top upon page navigation. But if you set `keepScrollPosition` to `true` then the page's scroll position is preserved instead.

It's commonly used for nested layouts such as tabs, see <Link href="/Layout#nested-layouts" />.

You can also control whether the scroll position is preserved on a link-by-link basis, see <Link href="/clientRouting#settings">`<a href="/some-url" keep-scroll-position />`</Link>.

> There is an experimental feature for preserving the scroll position between any arbitrary group of pages, see [#1854 `keepScrollPosition` between any arbitrary group of pages](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1854).
