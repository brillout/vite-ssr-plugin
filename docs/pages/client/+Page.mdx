The `+client.js` file adds client-side JavaScript. The code of `+client.js` is executed only once at the very beginning when the user goes to your website.

It's usually used for initializing the client-side code of <Link href="/errors">error tracking</Link>, user tracking, cookie consent, CSS frameworks, etc.

```js
// /pages/+client.js
// Environment: client

console.log("I'm the first line of client-side JavaScript.")
```

> In production, it's the first JavaScript code to be executed.
>
> In development, it's also first but only after Vite's HMR code. (In development, Vite's HMR preamble code needs to be run first. In production, the HMR preamble code isn't injected.)

> The code of `+client.js` isn't re-executed upon client-side navigation. For executing code upon the lifecycle of page rendering, see following hooks instead:
> - <Link href="/onHydrationEnd" />
> - <Link href="/onPageTransitionStart" />
> - <Link href="/onPageTransitionEnd" />
>
> If you don't use a <UiFrameworkVikeExtension />, then also see <Link href="/onRenderClient" />.
