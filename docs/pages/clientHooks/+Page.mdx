import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

The `clientHooks` setting determines whether <Link href="/hooks">hooks</Link> should be loaded on the client-side.

If `false` then hooks aren't loaded on the client-side (saving KBs).

> <Link href="/client">`+client.js`</Link> is always loaded, regardless of this setting. Set/<Link href="/config#inheritance">override</Link> the value of the `client` setting to `null` if you also want to skip loading `+client.js`.

The usual use case is to control what code is loaded on the client-side for HTML-only pages, see <Link href="/render-modes#html-only" doNotInferSectionTitle />.

By default, Vike sets its value to `true` (client-side hooks are loaded) if and only if:
 - <Link href="/onRenderClient">`onRenderClient()`</Link> is defined, and
 - <Link href="/Page">`Page`</Link> is defined and its <Link href="/meta#api">`meta.env.client`</Link> is `true`.

Use this setting to override the default:
 - Set to `false` if you want to skip loading hooks on the client-side (saving KBs).
 - Set to `true` if you want to ensure hooks are loaded on the client-side.
