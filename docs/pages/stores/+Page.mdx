> **What is a store?**
>
> A store (aka state management tool) is a tool that helps you manage complex UI state.

> Not properly managing UI state is one of the most (if not the most) common root cause for buggy user interfaces. A store enables you to get under control even the most complex UI state logic.

> A store usually works by representing state changes as atomic changes to an immutable data structure, enabling a fundamentally more robust state management.

In principle, you can use Vike with any store. For example:
- <Link href="/redux" />
- <Link href="/pinia" />
- <Link href="/vuex">Integration &gt; Vuex</Link>
- <Link href="/pullstate">Integration &gt; PullState</Link>
