Vike will soon introduce what we call an *Open Source Pricing*: a new kind of business model that keeps Vike open source, as well as accessible (so that everyone, regardless of financial resources, can use Vike).

- The entire code **stays 100% open source** (MIT License).
- Everything **stays 100% gratis for engineers**. You don't need any license key and you can use Vike without any restrictions, just like any other open source tool.
- **For companies:**
  - **Pay what you can**. Companies choose the amount they want to pay while we trust them to make a fair choice. (If too many pay too little, we may switch to a fixed pricing.)
  - **Free for small apps**. For new and small Vike apps, Vike is 100% gratis and you don't need any license key: everything works just like any other open source tool.
  - **Apply for a free license key**.  For larger apps, you can apply for a free license key if your team cannot afford one or didn't incorporate a company yet. Write two or three sentences explaining your situation and we will give you a free license key valid for six months (you can apply again after six months).

The Open Source Pricing is a major milestone for Vike's growth. It preserves what makes open source special while ensuring Vike's priorities are aligned with the interests of its users, for a transparent and sustainable relationship.

### How does it work?

For new or small projects nothing changes: you can use Vike just like any other open source tool for free and without any license key.

For larger projects, Vike shows a pesky toaster in production `Get your license key at ...` which you can remove by purchasing a license key and installing it with `$ vike add-key 4f7DK1q29X5WJ6G3b9t1`.

In theory, since Vike is 100% open source, you can fork Vike and remove the pesky toaster. But we will make the pesky toaster difficult to find &mdash; more difficult than applying for a free license key.


### Do sponsors have to pay?

No, Vike stays 100% gratis for companies sponsoring Vike (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum). Reach out and we will give you a free license key.


### Is Vike still Free Software?

Vike is still free as in "free speech" (not as in free beer), see explanations [by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

We believe in Libre Software and we invented the Open Source Pricing because <Link doNotInferSectionTitle href="#why-not-another-business-model" >other business models contradict Libre Software values</Link>.

Code remains not only 100% open source but also 100% accessible: we believe money (and the lack thereof) should never prevent anyone from using code.



### Why not another business model?

We believe other business models are flawed in fundamental ways.

The Open Source Pricing means:
- As an enginner, a much better software while everything stays 100% gratis.
- As a company, a transparent and sustainable relationship with a tool that is foundational to your stack.

Compared to other business models:
