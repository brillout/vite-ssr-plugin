## React Server Components

[React Server Components (RSC)](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components) is a new application architecture designed by the React team.

The design can be broken down into three parts:
 - :construction: Server Components
 -	✅ Server Actions
 -	✅ Partial Hydration

Vike supports <Link href="/stream#partial-hydration">Partial Hydration</Link> as well as <Link href="/RPC">Server Actions</Link>. Server Components is work-in-progress.

> Instead of using [Server Actions using `'use server'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations), we recommend using [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) which we believe to be a superior design. That said, a [`vike-react`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react) fork can be developed that supports `'use server'`.

> While [we are thrilled about Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188#issuecomment-754815233), we believe it isn't production ready yet.
>
> There are multiple reasons for that. For example, use cases that are essential such as infinite scroll aren't supported yet, [RFC: injectToStream](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/219) is a major blocker, and there doesn't seem to be a clear recommendation (yet) where to set the [`'use client'`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) boundaries (minimizing the number of client components is, counterintuitively, [not always the best strategy](https://twitter.com/cyco130/status/1663515982218838017)).
>
> Also, while the added value of Server Components which is to reduce the size of client-side bundles is definitely a nice-to-have, we believe the slight performance gain isn't worth the added DX complexity. We are hopeful this is going to change as the Server Components design matures: there are a couple of React frameworks that are experimenting and pushing the Server Components design forward. In the meantime, we recommend sticking to the classical and battle tested SSR/SPA/SSG approaches.

The most significant added value of the RSC architecture is its novel approach to SSR streaming which unlocks many exciting features around data fetching. Not only does Vike has first-class support for SSR streaming, but it also supports it in a unique way that enables both an easy DX as well as flexibility: you can integrate tools with the SSR stream manually yourself (e.g. using [react-streaming](https://github.com/brillout/react-streaming#readme)), or you can use built-in integrations such as [`vike-react-query`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react/tree/main/packages/vike-react-query#readme) and [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com).

> SSR streaming enables you to define components that can fetch data, while each of these data-fetching components are loaded and rendered independently of each other: the user sees a UI with non-data-fetching parts that are rendered quickly, and data-fetching parts that are rendered as data comes in. This leads to a significantly improved (perceived) page speed. See <Link href="/stream#partial-hydration">Partial Hydration</Link>.
