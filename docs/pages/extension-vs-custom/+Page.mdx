With Vike, you have the choice between:
- Using <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>, for a quick start.
- Or implementing your own custom integrations, for full control over integrating your favorite tools.

In general, we recommend using Vike extensions whenever possible, and falling back to a custom integration only if you have a clear reason to do so.

> Vike extensions are highly polished integrations. But they're also slightly opinionated and may not fit what you need.

If you aren't crystal clear about why don't want to use a Vike extension, then the answer is to go with the Vike extension.

For example:
 - Start using Vike with <UiFrameworkExtension name />.
 - If you run into a blocker because of <UiFrameworkExtension succint />, then create an issue/discussion at the GitHub repository of <UiFrameworkExtension succint />.
 - If a maintainer of <UiFrameworkExtension succint /> replies that resolving your blocker is out-of-scope, then start considering a custom integration.

> You can also eject a Vike extension, for progressively moving from the ejected implemention of the Vike extension towards a custom integration. See <Link href="/why#optional-control" />.

That said, many large companies need bespoke integrations and opting-out of Vike extensions is a sensible choice. If that's your case, then chances are that you already have clear reasons why you want to go for a custom integration.
