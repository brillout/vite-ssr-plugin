The `viewport` setting sets [the page's shown width on mobile devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag).

By default, it's assumed your page is responsive, and the following responsive `<meta name="viewport">` tag is injected:

```html
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
</head>
```

If your page isn't responsive, then we recommend setting a initial page width:

```js
// pages/+config.js

export default {
  // For example, the following value makes sense if your page looks good with a 1200px width.
  // The user will be able to manually change the viewport size with pinch gestures.
  viewport: 1200 // <meta name="viewport" content="width=1200" />
}
```

> On mobile devices, browsers will zoom the page so that a page width of `1200px` is shown to the user. For example, if the real width of the mobile screen is `600px` then the browser zooms out by a factor of `2x` in order to show a page width of `1200px`.

You can also set any aribtrary `<meta name="viewport">` tag:

```js
// pages/+config.js

export default {
  // Don't inject any `<meta name="viewport">` tag
  viewport: null
}
```
```js
// pages/+Head.js

// Same as default but adding `user-scalable=no` which makes sense for
// highly interactive apps such as games.
export default () => <>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no" />
</>
```
