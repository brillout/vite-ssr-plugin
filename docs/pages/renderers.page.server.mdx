Built-in renderers are full-fledged integrations with UI frameworks.

The following <Link text="integrations" href="/vike-packages" /> are currently being worked on:
 - [`vike-react`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react)
 - [`vike-vue`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-vue)
 - [`vike-solid`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid)

Contribution welcome to create renderers for other UI frameworks such as Svelte.
