## With Bâti

We recommend using [Bati](https://batijs.dev) to scaffold a new Vike app.

> Apps scaffolded by Bati use <Link href="/extensions">Vike extensions</Link>.

## Without Bâti

You can also scaffold a new Vike app that doesn't use any <Link href="/extensions">Vike extension</Link>, which means you control the UI framework (React/Vue/Solid/...) integration.

> See <Link href="/why#optional-control" />.

<Warning>
We recommend using the following command only if:
 - you are an expert user and you want control over integration code, or
 - you are curious.
</Warning>
