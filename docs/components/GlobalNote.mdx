This setting is global: it always applies to all your pages.

> You cannot define it at `pages/some-page/+config.js`: you have to define it at `pages/+config.js` (or some other global location).

> If you want to set a different setting for different pages, then consider creating a custom setting, see <Link href="/head#custom-settings" />
