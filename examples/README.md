For more, search [vike.dev](https://vike.dev) (`CTRL+K`) which lists many community examples.

For creating a new Vike app, we recommend using [Bati](https://batijs.dev) instead of copying the examples here. Because all examples here use a custom React/Vue integration instead of using `vike-react`/`vike-vue` which [we generally don't recommend](https://vike.dev/new#without-vike-react-vue-solid).
